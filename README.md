# TriangleStats
A simple graphing API made with JavaScript

***

**Disclaimer**: TriangleStats is still in its early stages of development and you are not likely to be taken seriously in a scientific, legal, or business, scholarly or other professional meeting or the like if you use it. Of course, if you do use it for some sort of professional purpose, I would love to know about it. TriangleStats was created for fun by CodeTriangle and was never meant to replace graphing programs like Microsoft Office Excel or OpenOffice/LibreOffice Calc, or statistics-based programming languages like R. Again, though, I wouldn't object if you did start using it.

As of the time of writing this, there is no API yet, just a collection of tests. An explanation of the tests:

**Adaptive Graphing**: The first test. It was my attempt at building a graph that you could choose the upper boundaries and where to put a single point.

More tests will be added soon, as well as documentation once there is something to document.
